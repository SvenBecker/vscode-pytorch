# Contributing to vscode-pytorch

As this project is still in a very early stage I would love for you to contribute and help make it better.
For contribution, here are the guidelines I would like you to follow:

1. [Issues and Bugs](#issue)
2. [Feature Requests](#feature)
3. [Submission Guidelines](#submit)
  1. [Submitting an Issue](#submit-issue)
  2. [Submitting a Pull Request](#submit-pr)

## <a name="issue" > </a> You found an Issue or a Bug?

If you find a bug or an issue in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help me by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SvenBecker/vscode-pytorch). Even better, you can [submit a Pull Request](#submit-pr) with a fix or a suggestion for a fix.

## <a name="feature" > </a> You want a certain Feature?

You can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SvenBecker/vscode-pytorch).

**Small Features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a Pull Request](#submit-pr). If you would like to have a specific code snippet you can also make a [Gist](https://help.github.com/articles/about-gists/) containing your desired code block.

## <a name="submit" > </a>Submission Guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue" > </a> Submitting an Issue

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
Help me to maximize the effort I can spend fixing issues and adding new features, by not
reporting duplicate issues. You can open an issue [here](https://github.com/SvenBecker/vscode-pytorch/issues/new).

### <a name="submit-pr" > </a> Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

[Pull Requests](https://github.com/SvenBecker/vscode-pytorch/pulls) are for me the most confenient way to make changes to the project. If you are not familiar with creating a Pull Request, here are some guides:
